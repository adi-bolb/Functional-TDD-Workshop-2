# Functional-TDD-Workshop

Repository for collection material and ideas for the second workshop on TDD with functional programming languages. The idea is the same as [last year](http://blog.johanneslink.net/2017/02/24/functional-tdd-workshop/), see also the [repository with samples from last year](https://github.com/jlink/Functional-TDD-Workshop).

This repository is supposed to contain code examples.

The [wiki](https://github.com/codecop/Functional-TDD-Workshop-2/wiki) is for
collecting ideas and topics relevant for the workshop and is open to anybody
interested in the subject.
